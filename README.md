# AI-ML-INTERNSHIP-ETG
This repository contains all the projects done during ETG internship.
## My first project is IMS-Inventory Management System.
1. This project reads product ID from the user, asks quantities of products and generates bill for that particular product.
2. It reads data from inventary.json and also creates sales.json which contains information of product sold.
## My second project is data analysis of Olympic data set.
1. We did the assignment using pandas library.
